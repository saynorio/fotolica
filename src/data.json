At the same time, with Donald Trump having taken office in the U.S., his administration's new trade policy stances, to a certain extent, are causing a lot of uncertainty and clouding the outlook for the Chinese economy, as the former trade rules are forced to be reconsidered. How does it affect trades between the Mainland and the U.S.? Meanwhile, as the political reshuffle in the Mainland continues, what does it mean for the global economy? What should business operators in the world's second largest economy do to deal with the changing political and economic environment? \n\nThe Chamber has invited Albert Louie, Founder and CEO of A. Louie Associates Limited, a risk management and crisis solutions consultancy, and China business strategy firm, to share his insights on risk and crisis management with members. \n\nLouie is the founder of A.

Louie's background includes a stint at Kroll Associates, a leading global risk management and consultancy corporation, where he was the Senior Director and Founding Chief Representative.
